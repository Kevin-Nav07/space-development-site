                            <p>Comets, with their pristine composition and unchanged state since the early solar system,
                                serve as celestial time capsules offering crucial insights into the conditions
                                prevailing during the formation of our cosmic neighborhood. Studying comets provides
                                scientists with a unique opportunity to unravel the mysteries of the solar system's
                                birth and evolution. Their significance in space exploration lies in the potential to
                                unlock key details about the origin of planets, the distribution of volatile elements,
                                and the broader dynamics that shaped the cosmos. </p>

                                efforts, providing valuable insights into the composition, dynamics, and magnetospheric
                                processes of these massive planets. Studying gas giants contributes to our understanding
                                of planetary formation, the broader solar system dynamics, and provides a basis for
                                comparative planetary science beyond Earth. </p>

        <h3>Exploring Deep Space: A Historical Journey</h3>
        <br><br>

        In 1957, merely three years after the Soviet Union launched the first artificial Earth satellite, a race
        between superpowers commenced, marking the dawn of deep space exploration. From the inaugural Pioneer 5
        mission in 1960 to the recent Juno mission in 2011, major space-faring nations launched a total of 118
        deep space missions. Of these, 72 succeeded or partially succeeded, 42 failed, and 4 are still en route,
        reflecting a commendable 63% success rate.
        <br>

        <h3>Eras of Deep Space Exploration</h3>
        <br>
        <br>

        Over the last 50 years, the evolution of deep space exploration can be categorized into three
        distinctive periods: the competitive era (1960-1979), characterized by a space race between the Soviet
        Union and the United States; the quiet era (1980-1994), during which the two nations analyzed and
        digested acquired data; and the maturity era (1995 onwards), where scientific objectives became the
        driving force, resulting in a total of 34 successful deep space missions.
        <br>
        <br>

        <h3>Global Participation and Celestial Focus</h3>

        To date, independent deep space exploration missions have been undertaken by the United States, the
        Soviet Union/Russia, Japan, and the European Union. The United States pioneered deep space exploration,
        spanning the sun, seven planets, small solar system bodies, and the extrasolar universe. While Russia's
        success rate is modest, Japan excelled in small solar system body exploration, and the European Space
        Agency (ESA) demonstrated high competence in a short time. Deep space missions have encompassed various
        celestial bodies, employing diverse exploration methods such as flyby, impact, orbiting, landing,
        roving, and sample return. Notably, Venus exploration peaked in the 1960s and 1970s, and extrasolar
        observation gained momentum in recent years, showcasing the ever-evolving landscape of deep space
        exploration.
